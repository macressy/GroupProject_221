## Roles
**John Parks:** Lead Data Collector and Visualizer - identify and pull all viable data inputs, determine how they coalesce for visualization, and decide and execute the ultimate visualizing of our analysis <br/>
**Joshua Claxton:** Police Violence Specialist - inform (maybe geostatistical) analysis, to be done on arrests, police beats, and incidents of escalated violence or fatal encounters, focusing on  the correlation to property values <br/>
**Miles Cressy:** Housing Specialist - clean and understand the data related to development, permitting, ownership vs. rent percentages, property values, etc. Conduct thorough analysis and provide visualizations through the lens of race data. 

## Status update
We are in frequent communication with a few scheduled calls per week and text group to share updates and coordinate. We are aligned in our approach to the project and have been mutually supportive in the vicissitudes that take place in any group project. Most importantly, we have all been very amenable to modifications and feedback as we refine our topic, scope, and analysis. The only limitation right now is ambition, perhaps. We have entertained a variety of ideas with great excitement and have had to back away and acknowledge constraints of time and our own skill level. 

## Data update
We have located a lot of housing data on HUD Open Data Center and HCD Website and are working through thoughts of tying the data together, experimenting with layering and merging data sets. We have an abundance of various kinds of police data that all contain geo coordinates, but are struggling to find data directly from the Sheriffâ€™s department. We need to explore how we can capture gentrification via data inputs that can aggregate into and index and be visualized--we had an idea to scrape Zillow listings, but that will require writing code that may be beyond our abilities at this stage. We also need to figure out how we will statistically analyze the relationship between policing and fluctuations in property values. We have discussed a hotspot analysis (based on the ArcGIS clustering toolset).
