### Research Question:

The United States (US) is a country of stark systemic inequality between racial groups. Communities of color have been subjected to and still experience exclusion, erasure, and negligence by US institutions. We will be investigating how these disparities geospatially persist in the Greater Los Angeles area. How can structural racism be quantified and visualized across Los Angeles neighborhoods through a multi-factor index?

### Why? 

"Racism, specifically, is the state-sanctioned or extralegal production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death"- (p.28 _Golden Gulag Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing_ , Ruth Wilson Gilmore)

We will measure vulnerability, as defined by Gilmore, across various communities that inhabit Los Angeles. Generally, the vulnerability that structural racism creates, and the restitution it necessitates, is accepted in the American political discourse. However, there remains a powerful contingent of media companies, politicians, and institutions that doubt our inequitable reality. Such denial functions as structural gaslighting to the narratives of communities of color, especially black folks given the persistent legacy of enslavement and exclusionary policies. We will be quantifying the experience of vulnerability through a geospatial index of Los Angeles, focusing on the dimensions of housing, pollution, police violence, and economic development. This endeavor serves to (a) bolster the community narratives that are too easily dismissed and (b) create helpful metrics for targeted public policy. In a cultural moment when truth and lived-experience is being invalidated, we believe our exploration and analysis to be of particular import. 

### Scope:

We will primarily focus our analysis on the neighborhoods within the Greater Los Angeles area. Within these geographic parameters, we are specifically exploring how vulnerability is distributed through property ownership, environmental risk, state violence, economic development, and rent burden. This may ultimately shift and adjust based on the availability of data that we can ascertain and is of particular interest but our intention is to understand the discrepancies between various communities within the Greater Los Angeles Area.

### Data Sources:

Demographic:

Environmental:

- [Enviroscreen](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40) - CalEnviroScreen is a mapping tool that helps identify California communities that are most affected by many sources of pollution, and where people are often especially vulnerable to pollution’s effects.CalEnviroScreen uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in the state.

Police:

- [Map My Neighborhood](https://map.myneighborhooddata.org/) - various data visualized and cataloged at the neighborhood level.

- [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) (from https://campaignzero.org/campaigns/) - Tracks and catalogs any incident where a law enforcement officer (off-duty or on-duty) applies, on a civilian, lethal force resulting in the civilian being killed whether it is considered “justified” or “unjustified” by the U.S. Criminal Legal System.

- [Deputy-Involved Shootings](https://lasd.org/transparency/deputyinvolvedshootingprevious/) - Tracker provided by LA Sheriff’s Department

- [Arrest Data](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-2019/yru6-6re4) - Tracker regarding arrest data provided LA City.


Economic:

- [Listing of Active Businesses](https://data.lacity.org/Administration-Finance/Listing-of-Active-Businesses/6rrh-rzua) - Listing of all active businesses currently registered with the Office of Finance. An "active" business is defined as a registered business whose owner has not notified the Office of Finance of a cease of business operations. Analysis of business listings may help demonstrate what kind of businesses dominate at-risk and minority communities.

SCAG COVID Vulnerability IndicatorShows a lot of pertinent information for the County and other areas regarding employment/rent burden/other items

Housing:

- [LAHD Affordable Housing Projects List](https://data.lacity.org/Housing-and-Real-Estate/LAHD-Affordable-Housing-Projects-List-2003-to-Pres/mymu-zi3s) LAHD financed projects since 2003 to present. These projects are financed with programs including Affordable Housing Managed Pipeline, Supportive Housing Program, Affordable Housing Bond Program, and the Proposition HHH Supportive Housing Loan Program. Enables us to visualize where affordable housing projects are being funded & developed and if they are being built in areas that require it.

- [Rent Burden | Census Data (5-Year ACS, 2021) ](https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2021_5yr/R13285211)- SE:A18002. Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income in the Past 12 Months (Dollars). Extracting the number of households that pay 30% or more of their monthly income toward rent serves as an approximate measure of rent burden.

### Analysis and Visualizations: 

Our project will aggregate housing, transit, police, and environmental data sets, listed above, with the aim of presenting this information as a detailed choropleth map.  This map will assist in data interpretation and visualizing inequities between areas within Los Angeles. 

Additionally, we will conduct a Hot Spot Analysis of this data, and our visualization, in order to project likelihood of encountering any/all of our inputs (housing issues, police violence, or environmental risks).  The inclusion of a Hot Spot Analysis directly addresses a guiding principle of this work; to demonstrate likelihood of vulnerability and exposure to a premature death.  

Our group may attempt to Keyword scrape from property listing websites in order to capture biases / popular narratives about certain neighborhoods, issues of gentrification, etc. 

### Conclusion:  

Our hypothesis and impetus for the project is that geospatial measurements can be aggregated to highlight structural racism, advancing cultural discourse and refining public policy. For example, we hope to quantify the magnitude of difference between a black person’s exposure to violence, pollution, and rent burden, in comparison to a white person. We acknowledge the limitations of our research, as structural racism is, by definition, pervasive and cannot merely be quantified by a finite index. As we adjust our index, we hope to highlight the inputs that have the most influence on vulnerability. Ultimately, visualizing and quantifying where rectification is most needed.
