    "### Race as Vulnerability: The Relationship between Policing and Gentrification\n",
    "#### John Parks, Joshua Claxton and Miles Cressy\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim for this midterm is to demonstrate our progress in assessing the relationship between policing and gentrification. We will do so by first exploring various metrics that help contribute to or inform the process of gentrification. Although there are numerous definitions of gentrification, we have strived to build a rough framework to define gentrification as the displacement of minority communities as a result of development forces. To demonstrate this working definition, we will delve into demographic shifts of renter-occupied households, development patterns through filing of building permits, and rent price changes and rent burden percentages by race. These metrics may change as we progress toward our final project but we hope the evaluation of these metrics get us closer to laying the foundation of our understanding of gentrification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the groundwork we lay for evaluating gentrification, we will dive into various forms of policing data and evaluate the relationship between policing and communities that are susceptible to gentrifying forces.  \n",

    "- We've successfully developed a better understanding of development patterns by neighborhood from the 2017 to 2021, with a particular focus on the black neighborhoods we isolated in the previous step.\n",
    "- Some interesting findings is that of the top neighborhoods with the largest demographic shift, the overall building permit issuance counts are relatively low (e.g. Adams-Normandie, Jefferson Park, Exposition Park, etc.). This may be caused by the fact that these neighborhoods are relatively small and any percent changes in demographic shifts would be weighted heavily. This is not necessarily incorrect or a negative outcome but something to keep in mind going forward. We will want to make sure the manner in which we classify neighborhoods is resilient to being misproportionately weighted.\n",

Taking into account how new developments are pricing their units (or a similar metric) would provide a better understanding of gentrifying forces. For the time being, average rent price suffices.\n",
